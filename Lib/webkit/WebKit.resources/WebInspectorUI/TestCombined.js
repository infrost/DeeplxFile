// Debouncer wraps a function and continues to delay its invocation as long as
// clients continue to delay its firing. The most recent delay call overrides
// previous calls. Delays may be timeouts, animation frames, or microtasks.
//
// Example:
//
//     let debouncer = new Debouncer(() => { this.refresh() });
//     element.addEventListener("keydown", (event) => { debouncer.delayForTime(100); });
//
// Will ensure `refresh` will not happen until no keyevent has happened in 100ms:
//
//               0ms          100ms         200ms         300ms         400ms
//     time:      |-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
//     delay:     ^     ^ ^        ^      ^        ^    ^   ^
//     refreshes:                                                         * (1)
